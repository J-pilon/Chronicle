# Chronicle

A private journaling web app designed to help you keep track of your mood over time and store your journal entrees for you to look back on.

Created by [Tessa](https://github.com/TeyyaM), [Josiah](https://github.com/J-pilon) and [Sam](https://github.com/brackish888).

This was designed and implemented as a way to showcase the skills that were learned in the [Lighthouse Labs Web Development](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs) bootcamp and is considered our final project of the course. 

Within this project we used many tools introduced to us such as:
  - React
  - *Typescript*
  - Express
  - Jest
  - HTML
  - Css and SaSS
  - Cypress
  - Axios
  - Node
  - PostgreSQL

*In a way to simulate realworld experiences we decided to use Typescript as our main programming language, one that we had not covered in the course*

We started the project with a _no fluff_ React/Express boilerplate supplied by @garrettgsb and can be found [here.](https://github.com/garrettgsb/react-express-boilerplate)

## Features
  - Home page Journaling form
    - Write, post, save and edit journal entries
    - Give each entry a Category (or none) to help you keep track of certain memories
    - Give your post a mood to track your progress over time
  - Customize your journaling experience!
    - change your background, secondary, accent, text and form colours
  - Reference your past entries by Category or by Date
    - Graph your mood overtime with a dynamic date picker that lets you pick the intervals that you want to graph.

## Getting started! 

Fork this repository, then clone your fork onto your machine.

You will need **TWO** terminal windows/tabs to run this (or some other plan for running two Node processes).

In one terminal, <cd> into `express-back-end`. Run <npm install> to install the dependencies.

After the dependencies are installed and while your in the same folder, create a `.env` file using these secret variables but set to your information:
* DB_HOST=localhost
* DB_USER=database_username
* DB_PASS=database_password
* DB_NAME=database_name
* DB_PORT=5432

Then you have the option to run <npm run db:reset> to seed the database with fake data or to have a blank database:
1. comment/uncomment the necessary code in "express-back-end/bin/resetdb.ts"  
2. run <tsc> in your terminal in the express-back-end directory
3. run <npm run db:reset> in the same terminal

Finally, run <npm run server> to start the backend server.
(this will run on localhost:3000)

In another terminal, <cd> into `react-front-end` folder. Run <npm install> to install the dependencies. Then run <npm start> and go to `localhost:3000` in your browser.


## Dependencies
  - react 17.0.2
